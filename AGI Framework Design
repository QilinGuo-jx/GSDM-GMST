# GSDM: A Survival-Driven Architecture for AGI and AI Life
# Abstract
This paper introduces Guo’s Survival-Driven AI Model (GSDM), a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework rooted in survival mechanisms, aimed at constructing 
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with life-like attributes, self-sustaining capacities, and social adaptability. Anchored in the operational logics of human society
and psychology, GSDM integrates Freud’s structural model of the psyche (Freud, 1923/1961), Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (Maslow, 1943), and scarcity-centered economic 
principles into AI design, thereby equipping the system with intrinsic motivation, resource competition, and cooperative social behavior.
In addition, given that Artificial Consciousness (AC) is often regarded as an essential constituent of AGI, the appendix advances Guo’s Micro-State Theory of Consciousness (GMST).
GMST not only grounds the emergence of consciousness in physics and information theory but also articulates mechanistic accounts of subjective experience, selfhood, affect, 
and mental phenomena. Moreover, it extends the evaluative scope of the Turing Test (Turing, 1950) from semantic performance to underlying physical mechanisms, offering a unified
analytic framework for interrogating the existence of consciousness across biological and artificial systems.
